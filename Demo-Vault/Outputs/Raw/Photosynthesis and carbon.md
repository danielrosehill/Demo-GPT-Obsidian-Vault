### **Prompt**

How does photosynthesis contribute to the carbon cycle?

### **Output**

Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle by converting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic compounds in plants. During this process, plants absorb CO₂ through their leaves and, using sunlight, produce glucose and oxygen. This not only provides energy for the plant but also reduces atmospheric CO₂ levels, which helps regulate global climate. The carbon stored in plants eventually re-enters the atmosphere through respiration, decay, or combustion, completing the cycle.
