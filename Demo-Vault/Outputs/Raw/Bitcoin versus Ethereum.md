What are the main differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum?

### **Output**

While both Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized blockchain networks, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency designed as a store of value and medium of exchange. Its main focus is security and immutability. Ethereum, on the other hand, goes beyond currency by enabling smart contractsâ€”self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain. This makes Ethereum more versatile for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based services. Additionally, Ethereum's blockchain supports the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, unlike Bitcoin.
