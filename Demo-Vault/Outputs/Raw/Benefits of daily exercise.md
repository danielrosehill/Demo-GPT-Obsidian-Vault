### **Output**

Engaging in daily exercise has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Physically, regular activity can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and strengthen bones and muscles. It's recommended that adults aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week.

Mentally, exercise is known to boost mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. This is due to the release of endorphins, which act as natural mood lifters. Incorporating exercise into your daily routine can significantly enhance overall well-being and improve quality of life.
