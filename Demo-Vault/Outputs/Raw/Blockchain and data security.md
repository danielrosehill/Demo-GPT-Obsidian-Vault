# Prompt

Explain how blockchain technology ensures data security.

### **Output**

Blockchain technology enhances data security through decentralization and cryptographic hashing. Each block of data is linked to the previous one in a chain, and any attempt to alter a block would change its cryptographic hash, alerting the network to tampering. Additionally, since blockchain operates across a distributed network of nodes, no single entity controls the data, reducing the risk of hacking or unauthorized alterations. This decentralized, immutable structure makes blockchain highly secure for various applications, including finance and data storage.
