How do you create a personal budget?

### **Output**

Creating a budget is a crucial step towards financial health. Start by listing all your sources of income, including salaries, bonuses, and any side income. Next, track your monthly expenses by categorizing them into fixed (like rent and utilities) and variable expenses (like groceries and entertainment).

Once you have a clear view of your income and expenses, determine where you can cut back and allocate funds towards savings or debt repayment. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your budget will help you stay on track and achieve your financial goals.
