### **Prompt**

What are the environmental impacts of single-use plastics?

### **Output**

Single-use plastics have significant environmental impacts, primarily due to their persistence in ecosystems and their contribution to pollution. These plastics often end up in landfills or oceans, where they take hundreds of years to degrade, harming wildlife and marine life in the process. Additionally, the production of single-use plastics involves the use of fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing the use of single-use plastics is critical to mitigating environmental damage and preserving ecosystems.
