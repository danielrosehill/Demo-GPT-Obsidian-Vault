### **Prompt**

Explain the concept of "survivorship bias" in decision-making.

### **Output**

Survivorship bias occurs when we focus only on successful outcomes, ignoring those that failed or did not make it through a particular selection process. This bias can lead to flawed decision-making because it creates an inaccurate view of the factors contributing to success. For example, focusing only on successful companies while ignoring those that failed may lead to overestimating the chances of success in entrepreneurship. Recognizing survivorship bias helps individuals make more balanced, data-driven decisions.
