What is the difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)?

### **Output**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, language understanding, and problem-solving. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that specifically involves training algorithms on large datasets to allow systems to learn from experience and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed. While AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, ML focuses on data-driven learning and prediction.
