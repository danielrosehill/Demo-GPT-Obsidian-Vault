Traveling by air for the first time can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. Here are some essential tips to ensure a smooth experience. First, arrive at the airport early to allow time for check-in and security screening—aim for at least two hours before your flight. Second, familiarize yourself with your airline's baggage policies to avoid unexpected fees.

Additionally, don’t forget to keep your travel documents, boarding pass, and ID handy. It’s also wise to pack a small carry-on bag with essentials like snacks, a water bottle (empty until after security), and entertainment options for the flight. Finally, try to stay calm and enjoy the journey!
