How does sleep affect cognitive function?

### **Output**

Adequate sleep is essential for cognitive function, as it helps consolidate memory, enhances learning, and improves focus. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information gathered throughout the day, making it easier to recall later. Sleep also plays a critical role in clearing metabolic waste from the brain, which contributes to clearer thinking and decision-making. Chronic sleep deprivation, on the other hand, can impair cognitive abilities, leading to problems with attention, reasoning, and problem-solving.
