Outside of work, I have a wide array of interests that keep me engaged. I'm deeply passionate about urban gardening and maintain a small but productive balcony garden where I grow herbs, tomatoes, and even strawberries. Gardening provides me a much-needed sense of connection to nature, even amidst city life. I also enjoy cycling, often taking long weekend rides to explore different parts of the city and its surroundings.

Another interest of mine is exploring generative art using artificial intelligence. It’s been fascinating to experiment with different models and see how technology can blend into creative pursuits. I’ve even made some AI-generated pieces for my home that my friends and family often compliment. It feels rewarding to combine my love for technology and creativity in this way.
