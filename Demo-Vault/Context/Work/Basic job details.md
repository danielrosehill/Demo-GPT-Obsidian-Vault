I currently work as a Senior Communications Strategist at GreenPath Consulting, a firm specializing in environmental and sustainability projects. My primary role involves developing communication strategies that bridge the gap between environmental research and the public. I work with a talented team of content writers, social media specialists, and graphic designers to ensure our campaigns resonate with diverse audiences.

Much of my work revolves around coordinating with non-profit organizations and government bodies to promote sustainable practices. Recently, I've focused on developing outreach programs for initiatives that combat plastic pollution in marine environments. I love that my job allows me to combine creativity with advocacy for environmental stewardship, and I'm especially proud when I see our campaigns drive real change.
