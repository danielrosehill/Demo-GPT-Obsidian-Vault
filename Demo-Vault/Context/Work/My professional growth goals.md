I have a few professional growth goals that I’m working towards over the next couple of years. First, I want to deepen my understanding of digital storytelling, particularly using data visualization and interactive content to tell compelling stories. I believe these skills would enhance my ability to communicate complex topics, like climate change, to a broader audience in ways that are both informative and emotionally engaging.

Secondly, I’m keen to improve my management skills. As my team grows, I want to be the kind of leader who can effectively mentor others, helping them thrive in their roles while also balancing the pressures of our project timelines. I’ve already begun enrolling in a couple of leadership courses to learn about different management techniques, with a focus on empathy and collaboration.
